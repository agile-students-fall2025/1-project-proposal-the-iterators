## Project Title
Flavors & Fortunes

*(A whimsical, interactive Chinese food experience)*
## What and why?
For this project, I would like to build an interactive, playful mobile web app for Chinese food enthusiasts, inspired by one of my projects for another class. The system blends the joy of discovering new dishes with the mystical charm of fortune cookies. Users can explore, review, and share their experiences of dining and trying out new recipes while recieving a personalized fortune message from the All-Knowing Golden Masters, a fictional order of wise fortune cookies who "guard the archive of flavors".

The problem it solves is that while many people love exploring restaurants and recipes, there are few digital platforms that make this experience both fun and personal. Most review apps feel functional and plain; they lack the sense of play, community, and discovery. Flavors & Fortunes addresses this gap by creating a space that is not only informative but also imaginative, offering silly, fortune-like interactions alongside practical food exploration features. 

This is important because food is more than sustenance â€” it's cultural storytelling, memory, and joy. BY wrapping food reviews in whimsical interactions, the system encourages people to preserve and share their culinary experiences in a way that feels engaging rather than transactional.
## For Whom?
The primary users are Chinese food enthusiasts, including students, friends, family and food lovers like myself who enjoy exploring new dishes and sharing experiences online. Unlike large, anonymous review platforms, this project is aimed at a community of peers who value both fun and cultural connection. 

The secondary users could include people who enjoy whimsicial web interactions or anyone interested in playful alternatives to Yelp-style reviews. 
## How?
From the end-user's perspective, the system works as follows:
- Archive Pages (Restaurant & Recipe Reviews): Users can browse dishes that others have reviewed. Each review is treated as an "offering" to the Golden Masters. Reviews can include user-uploaded photos of the dish, making the archive visually enaging and more authentic. 
- Interactive Features:

    - Users can perform the "eat" interaction on the posts/dish to add it to their saved list of dishes they'd like to try.
    - Once saved, dishes appear in the Saved Page, where users can keep track of food they want to explore.
    - Users can later mark & review dishes they have actually tried, turning their digital wish list into a record of their culinary journey. 
-  Fortune Rewards: Submitting a review gifts the user a personalized fortune, reinforcing the playful and mystical theme. 
- Account System: Users can register and log in so their saved lists, photos, and fortunes are unique to them.
